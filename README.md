# local-Autoregressive Conditional Normalizing flows

Code repository for Locality-constrained autoregressive cum conditional normalizing flow for lattice field theory simulations
 ([arXiv:2304.01798](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01798)).
There's a [Demo](torch/demo.ipynb) file in the form of Jupyter notebook to get started.
